The goal of the repository is to give to the community access to my scripts.
These scripts are written in Javascript with Pixinsight API and libraries
These script helps Pixinsight users to ease there image processing.
You can find a script about creating some masks such background mask, object mask, star mask... Easely without any parameter.
Another script is Pixelmath blending which allow you automating SHO/HOO image creation with diffents blendings.
This repository contains french version and english version.

Please make sure you download also the .xmp file (logo file) when you download a script and include it into the same folder of the script.
